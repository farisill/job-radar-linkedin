# job-radar-linkedin

Job Radar is a browser extension that helps you browse LinkedIn job postings more easily. It checks each job card for your chosen keywords and highlights the ones that are relevant to you. It’s a simple way to filter through listings and quickly notice roles that match your interests.

The extension is currently being designed and tested for Firefox.

The project is entirely written with Claude.

-- HOW TO ADD TO FIREFOX --

1. Open Firefox and go to:

about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox

2. Click “Load Temporary Add-on…”.

3. Navigate to the extension folder and select manifest.json.

The extension will remain active until you close your browser.
When you reopen Firefox, you will need to load the extension again.

-- WHERE DOES IT WORK --

1. On the Recommended Jobs page on LinkedIn.
    -   Go to Jobs in the toolbar.
    -   Look for “Top job picks for you” and open any job card, or click “Show all →”.

2. On any individual job page.

3. On LinkedIn job search result pages.

-- WHAT IT DOES --

You need to set one or more keywords. The extension will compare these keywords against the information in each job description. If a match is found, the extension will display visual indicators for jobs that match and for those that do not.

The buttons are self-explanatory.

Enjoy using the extension!
